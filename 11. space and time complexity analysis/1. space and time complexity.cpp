Theoretical analysis

both time and space are going to be some 
function of input.

Time   ^   f(n)   >> quadratic, linear, constant
                        N^2       
space  ^   f(n)   >> 


for eg.

N -10N
T -10^2T   

Notation:

O(N^2)

Time = CN^2


Q. find largest element in a sorted array.
 >> we know the largest element is last, so we 
 can find this in constant time. O(n)
