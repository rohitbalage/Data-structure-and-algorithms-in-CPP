/*
Backtracking: algorithmic technique in which we recursively try to build the solutions

-It is an alorithmic technique
-Recursively trying to build  a solution
-Searching the entire search space to solve computation problem


Problem types:
Decision problem: check for feasible solution
Optimization problem: find best solutions
Enumeraion problem:  find all solutions


classical problems:
1. rat in maze
2. N queen problem
