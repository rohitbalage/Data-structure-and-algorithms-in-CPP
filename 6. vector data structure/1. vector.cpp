/*
1. vectors are sequence "containers" representing arrays that can
change the size.
2. just like arrays, vectors use contiguous storage locations for their elements, which means that their
elements can also be accessed directly in O(1) time.

3. but unlike arrays, their size can change dynamically, with theier storage being handled automatically
by the container.

1. How? --->  fundamentals

2. Use?  -----> problems
